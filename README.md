# FundIt!

## Vision
FundIt! aims to bridge the gap between visionary developers and the resources needed to bring new ideas/projects to life. Our mission is to democratize access to funding, ensuring that brilliant ideas receive the support they require, irrespective of the project team's size or network.

## Problems Solved
- **Access to Funding**: Many promising projects struggle to secure funding through traditional venture capital or grants due to the niche and complex nature of their work.
- **Community Involvement**: The decision-making process for funding often lacks community involvement, leading to a disconnect between what the community values and what gets funded.
- **Transparency in Funding**: The opacity of grant allocation processes can deter talented developers from applying, unsure of whether their proposals will be fairly considered.

## Solution Approach
FundIt addresses these challenges by:
- **Democratizing Funding**: By allowing anyone to contribute to the funding pool with ERC20 tokens, we've broadened the base of potential supporters beyond traditional funding entities.
- **Empowering Contributors with Voting Rights**: Contributors have a say in which projects are funded, ensuring that community values directly influence funding decisions.
- **Enhancing Transparency**: The entire process, from contribution to proposal submission and voting, is conducted on-chain, providing unparalleled transparency and trust.

## Technologies Used
- **Scaffold-eth2 Toolkit**: Leveraged for rapid development and testing, scaffold-eth2 provided a robust framework for building our dApp, significantly speeding up the iteration cycles.
- **Sablier for Streaming Payments**: Integration with Sablier enabled us to adopt a novel approach to funding by streaming money to grantees, ensuring continuous support for projects and accountability for milestones reached.
- **Arbitrum One & Nova**: Utilizing the scalability solutions offered by Arbitrum One and Nova allowed our platform to achieve high transaction throughput while maintaining low costs, crucial for a community-driven funding platform.
- **Base**: The implementation on Base further emphasizes our commitment to scalability and ensuring that our platform remains accessible and efficient as the Ethereum ecosystem evolves.

## Build Process
1. **Initial Conceptualization**: The project started with a clear vision to support projects, identifying key pain points in traditional funding mechanisms.
2. **Rapid Prototyping with scaffold-eth2**: Using the BuildGuidl's scaffold-eth2 toolkit, we quickly moved from idea to prototype, establishing the core functionalities of funding pools, proposal submissions, and voting.
3. **Integrating Sablier for Payment Streaming**: To ensure grantees receive funds in a transparent and accountable manner, we integrated Sablier, setting a precedent for how blockchain projects can be funded over time.
4. **Deployment on Scalable Infrastructure**: Recognizing the importance of scalability and low transaction costs, we deployed our platform on Arbitrum One, Nova, and Base, ensuring our solution is future-proof and capable of handling high volumes of transactions and interactions.

## How to Contribute/Get Involved
We welcome contributions from developers, designers, content creators, and anyone enthusiastic about advancing privacy and ZK technologies. Whether it's contributing to the code, participating in funding pools, or spreading the word, every bit of support helps us move closer to our vision.
